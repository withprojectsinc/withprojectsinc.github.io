           <p>
A serial limited edition art book published by W/—— Projects, White Zinfandel is devoted to the visual manifestation of food and culture. White Zinfandel is the continuation of a curatorial experiment, coupling food and art as a reliable means of provoking unexpected reactions, cravings and curiosities. The food inspired topics extend to the launch of every issue, with a curated menu concepted with an invited chef.</p><p>
This publication emerged right before the explosion of food culture and industry. This publication deviated from other mass publications with its curatorial agenda, each issue being celebrated at Art Basel, NADA, and LA Art Book Fairs in collaboration with celebrated chefs such as Ignacio Mattos, executive chef of Flora Bar at the Met Breuer. Contributors to White Zinfandel include a range of emerging and established voices in the creative and fine arts world that include Pedro Gadhano, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Josh Kline, Seth Zucker, Marina Abramovic, Chris Burden, Simon Castets, Cyril Duval, Maia Ruth Lee, Ruby Sky Stiler, Lucy Kim, Titus Kaphar, Mary Reid Kelly, Davide Balula, Sara Greenberger Rafferty and many more.</p>
            
            <p>
Despite its original platform as a print edition, every aspect of the publication’s theme is considered during the launch—the location, the special limited edition objects, down to the menus prepared for the guests.</p><p>Published as a limited edition art series (500 copies each issue), this publication is in the permanent collection of a number of major art and academic institutions such as MoMA, PS1, New Museum, RISD, Standford, Yale and many more, and has been recognized by the New York Times as, “Imagine if Marcel Duchamp guest edited Bon Appétit.”</p><p></p>

            <p>Re-inventing Food Culture</p>
        
           <p>
A serial limited edition art book published by W/—— Projects, White Zinfandel is devoted to the visual manifestation of food and culture. White Zinfandel is the continuation of a curatorial experiment, coupling food and art as a reliable means of provoking unexpected reactions, cravings and curiosities. The food inspired topics extend to the launch of every issue, with a curated menu concepted with an invited chef.</p><p>
This publication emerged right before the explosion of food culture and industry. This publication deviated from other mass publications with its curatorial agenda, each issue being celebrated at Art Basel, NADA, and LA Art Book Fairs in collaboration with celebrated chefs such as Ignacio Mattos, executive chef of Flora Bar at the Met Breuer. Contributors to White Zinfandel include a range of emerging and established voices in the creative and fine arts world that include Pedro Gadhano, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Josh Kline, Seth Zucker, Marina Abramovic, Chris Burden, Simon Castets, Cyril Duval, Maia Ruth Lee, Ruby Sky Stiler, Lucy Kim, Titus Kaphar, Mary Reid Kelly, Davide Balula, Sara Greenberger Rafferty and many more.</p>
            
            <p>
Despite its original platform as a print edition, every aspect of the publication’s theme is considered during the launch—the location, the special limited edition objects, down to the menus prepared for the guests.</p><p>Published as a limited edition art series (500 copies each issue), this publication is in the permanent collection of a number of major art and academic institutions such as MoMA, PS1, New Museum, RISD, Standford, Yale and many more, and has been recognized by the New York Times as, “Imagine if Marcel Duchamp guest edited Bon Appétit.”</p><p></p>

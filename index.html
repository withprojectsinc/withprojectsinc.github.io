        <p>About</p><p>
        With Projects, Inc. is a multidisciplinary creative agency founded by Jiminie Ha in 2008. With a collective background in fine arts, curation, creative direction, design, publishing and fashion, With Projects, Inc. has since expanded, taking on a unique approach to making and imagining brands from concept to execution.</p><p>The agency has been awarded the Rome Prize 2012 and D&AD Award for excellence in Publication/Newspapers design in 2015. In 2016 With Projects' digital campaign for Condé Nast was nominated for a Cannes Lion Award. With Projects, Inc. was nominated for the 2017 Cooper Hewitt National Design Award for Communication Design. Most recently With Projects is the winner of three TDC66 Awards for their book publications.</p><p>Interested in the intersections between the various creative fields, White Zinfandel, created by With Projects, Inc., is a continuation of this curatorial experiment, coupling food and art as a reliable means to provoke unexpected reactions, cravings and curiosities.</p>

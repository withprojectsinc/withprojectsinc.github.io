                With Projects, Inc. is a multidisciplinary creative agency founded by Jiminie Ha in 2008. With a collective background in fine arts, curation, creative direction, design, publishing and fashion, With Projects, Inc. has since expanded, taking on a unique approach to making and imagining brands from concept to execution.</p>
            <p>The agency has been awarded the Rome Prize 2012 and D&AD Award for excellence in Publication/Newspapers design in 2015. In 2016 With Projects' digital campaign for Condé Nast was nominated for a Cannes Lion Award. With Projects, Inc. was nominated for the 2017 Cooper Hewitt National Design Award for Communication Design. Most recently With Projects is the winner of three TDC66 Awards for their book publications.</p>
            <p>Interested in the intersections between the various creative fields, White Zinfandel, created by With Projects, Inc., is a continuation of this curatorial experiment, coupling food and art as a reliable means to provoke unexpected reactions, cravings and curiosities.</p>

            <p>Converted from a tiny storefront storage space in the heart of Chinatown, W/—— Project Space was a small gallery space started in 2008.</p>
            <p>

                Playing with limitations of space, time and resources, With Projects began as a collaborative experiment with like-minded creatives from the fine arts, design, multimedia, technology and architecture to play with these parameters to create dynamic and interactive temporary installations in Chinatown that could evolve.</p>
            <p>

                Given one month to exhibit work, contributors were also encouraged to invite other participants to disrupt their pieces in ways that could add onto their work over time. </p>
            <p>

                Collaborators included Keegan McHargue, Amy Yao, musicians Glasser, Arp, Hunter Hunt Hendrix/Liturgy, Rafael Rozendaal, Yemenwed, Peter Sutherland, Confetti System, 2x4, and many more.</p>
            <p>

                The body of work curated and generated during this time was awarded the American Academy in Rome Prize in 2012.
